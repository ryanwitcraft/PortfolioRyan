        <h4>Flow Map Interpretation</h4>
        <p>
          Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas have the largest amount of population movement. Oklahoma has the largest in migration along with one of the largest out-migrations. There is a trend of the population moving more to the Midwest and Southern Midwest. Most people are migrating to places with a large out-migration flow as well, so it seems like the population is moving and spreading out.         </p>
        <p>
          The general direction would be to the South-West since that is where many of the flows are going, especially higher population flows. The choropleth map along with the proportional point symbology show the more West, the more migration occurring. Large populations migrating are also mainly in the same area migrating to each other.         </p>
        <p>
          The flow patterns line up with the node symbol and choropleth map. This makes sense because there is relation from the flow data being used to display the other symbology. I think the symbology for this works well with the map because it lets the reader see the data that the flow pattern is visualizing. The node symbol shows how much the population grew from immigration, the choropleth map displays how much the population lost to migration, and the flow lines show the direction that each population went. The classification method for both the flows along with the choropleth map was natural breaks and a class size of 4. The classification method was chosen because it displayed the data most evenly out of the methods. No data is really drowned out and the teardrop flow shape makes sure you can tell the flows apart from each other. The top flows were left at the default 100 since that displayed the majority of the direction and adding more cluttered the map. Showing more evenly distributed symbology helps show direction and the other symbology helps the reader interpret the movement of the flows.         </p>
