        <h4>Final Project Information</h4>
        For this project my teammate and I created several maps that visually display surface water impairment type and count by lakes and streams. 
        Related field use data is also utilized in order to visually compare land use type to impairment type and count. 
        There are also several charts that display impairment type and the count specific to the type. 
        The charts also include visualization of the hazard levels of each type. 
        There are six maps within this project notebook, the first two are simple maps that were created in order to show the viewer the basic data that we were working with. 
        The fourth map shows the field use data that was used to create some variables for the following map and allows the viewer to see the data that was then transformed to improve visability as the fields were much too small to visualize on their own effectively.
        The last two maps show the comparison between dominant land use in each county compared to the dominant impairments in each lake/stream. The first of the last two maps shows number of impairments for the lakes and streams while the second displays the dominant impairment type. 
        These allow the viewer to see how agricultural land use affects lakes and streams.
